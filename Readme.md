<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![PSYdoc](./readme-src/screen1.png)
*What is PSYdoc?*

PSYdocs allows for **pseudonymous signing of documents** on the Ethereum network. You no longer have to worry about your confidential documents with personal details being stored forever on a central server! With PSYdoc the **document doesn't leave your device!**

*How does it work?*

**Each document is hashed locally on your browser** and the resulting hash is sent to the PSYdoc's smart-contract, where it is **minted as an NFT**. It has all the features of ERC-721 standand, which means that it can change hands just like any other **NFT**.

The person who mints the NFT becomes the owner of it and their address is automatically added to the **list of signees**. They in turn can invite other addresses to sign the document/ NFT by **inviting them through the smart-contract**. After an address is invited, they can easily sign the document.

*What problems does it solve?*

1. If the document is tampered with, the hash of the file changes. So, this allows for checking for any foul play on the side of the issuer.
2. The document/NFT remains on the blockchain forever, unless it is burnt.
3. As mentioned above, your file won't be hosted on some central server.

*Is it legal binding?*

To get a local copy up and running follow these steps.
Or if you just want to get a demo of the site, [click here](https://psydoc.vercel.app/)

### Prerequisites

This project requires npm, node & truffle installed.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
* truffle
  ```
  npm install truffle -g
  ```

### Installation

#### a) Compiling and Deploying the contracts
</br>


1. Get <a href="https://infura.io/">Infura API </a>for deploying to the testnets

2. Install the required npm packages
```
cd contracts && npm install
```
2. Create a .env file in /contracts folder
```
touch .env
```
3. Put the mnemonic of you wallet and the above mentioned Infura API to the .env file
```
mnemonic='input your mnemonic here'
urlRopsten='https://ropsten.infura.io/v3/yourAPI'
urlKovan='https://kovan.infura.io/v3/yourAPI'
urlRinkeby='https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/yourAPI'
urlGorli='https://goerli.infura.io/v3/yourAPI'
urlMumbai='https://polygon-mumbai.infura.io/v3/yourAPI'
```
4. Migrate the contracts to testnets, one by one.
```
truffle migrate --network gorli
truffle migrate --network rinkeby
truffle migrate --network ropsten
truffle migrate --network kovan
truffle migrate --network mumbai
```
---
</br> 

#### b) Running the React app

1. Install the required npm packages
```
cd client && npm install
```
2. Run the React app
```
npm start
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### 1. Minting a document as NFT.
* Select the file
* Click on submit
* After it's minted, you can invite people to sign your document by clicking on 'invite' button. (See 3.)
>> P.S 
The minter is by default a signee on the NFT

### 2. Signing a document
* Select the TokenID.
* Select the file which you want to sign. (This step is to verify that you are signing the right document)
* Click on 'verify' to see if the hashes match.
* If it's a match, you can go ahead and sign the document.
